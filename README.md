Node Generator.sh
===============
### Description:
This is a node server generator that runs off of a bash script. It will generate a fully modularized back end code base with basic CRUD operations.

### Usage:
1. Change the top line (#! /Users/Howi/bin/bash) to your bash location.
2. Use chmod to allow access and ability to run the script.
3. Run the script.
4. After answering the questions, you'll have a new project folder.
5. Inside that project folder, use npm install!
6. Run the server (main file is server.js)
